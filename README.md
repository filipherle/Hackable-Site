# Hackable-Site
A very easy website to practice hacking on. WILL BE UPDATED OFTEN
==========================
Made with Flask for Python 2.x
--------------------------
So far this website only is vulnerable to cross site scripting, but will be made into a all-around vulnerable site.

# How to hack

When you run the program (vulnerable.py) it will start the website on your localhost.

Just follow the link on the program and run it you will then see some text.

To exploit this put '?name=xxxx' after the whole link.

You will then see that 'xxxx' will be printed onto the screen as your name

This website can be used for testing hacking tools and ethical hacking.
